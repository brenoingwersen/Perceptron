# Perceptron for binary classification problems

In this simple and small project I go through the creation of a perceptron to solve a simple binary classification problem (supervised learning) which can be solved lineary.

The perceptron is a single layer of an Artificial Neural Network which uses a step function as activation function and updates its parameters multiplying its weights component by the difference between the actual target and the predicted upon feedforwarding the input through the layer. The is process is repeated acording to the number of iterations.

In this simple project I worked through concepts of basic linear algebra and good Python programming practices such as the creation of a docstring and the Perceptron class.

As the final result, if the problem is linear separable:
